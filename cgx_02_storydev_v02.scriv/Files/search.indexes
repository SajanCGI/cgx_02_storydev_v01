FADE IN:

INT. DRISKILL HOTEL SEMINAR ROOM - DAY

JOE and APRIL burst through the doors into a clean, well-lit
seminar room.

                                             JOE
                           Are we in time?

                                             APRIL
                           How could they start without us?
                           We’re the main attraction.

Joe catches his breath as he leans against the podium at the
front of the room.

                                             JOE
                                  (looking about

                                    the room)
                           We are?

                                             APRIL
                           Don’t be an idiot. You know we’ve
                           been invited to Austin to discuss
                           script format.

                                             JOE
                           But why is the room empty?

April and Joe look out across the room - rows of empty chairs
and nary a person in sight.

                                             APRIL
                           Okay, okay. Don’t panic.

She takes three deep breaths. Then April looks at her watch
and smiles.

                                             APRIL (CONT’D)
                           We’re an hour early. . . . We
                           should rehearse.

                                             JOE
                           Okay, you start. Margins?

                                             APRIL
                           Left, 1.5 inches. Right, 1.0
                           inches. Top, 1.0 inches to the
                           body, 0.5 inches to the number.
                           Bottom, 0.5 to 1.5 inches,
                           depending upon where the page break
                           comes.


                                                                                                    2.

                                             JOE
                           Page break?

                                             APRIL
                           Right above you. There are rules
                           for breaking a page. Scene headers
                           remain attached to description. A
                           single line of dialogue is pushed
                           to the following page. A long
                           dialogue passage would be split -
                           but I’ll get to that later.

                                             JOE
                           What about fonts?

                                             APRIL
                           Courier, 12-point, 10-pitch. Make
                           sure it’s a non-proportional
                           version of Courier and avoid
                           Courier New unless you want your
                           script to be about 10% longer.

                                             JOE
                           What about bold-face or italics? Or
                           a cool font like Garamond? I love
                           to jazz up my scripts.

                                             APRIL
                           Mostly, you should steer clear of
                           bold and italics. Definitely no
                           Garamond, no Helvetica, no Times
                           Roman. Stick with Courier. That’s
                           the industry standard.

                                             JOE
                           Ah . . . we’re talking about
                           industry standards.

Suddenly, Joe bolts from behind the podium and runs out into:

INT. DRISKILL HOTEL HALLWAY - DAY

Joe glances up and down the hallway, then reaches back to
open the door.

                                             JOE
                                  (calling)
                           April - come on! There’s no one
                           here.


                                                                                                    3.

                                             APRIL
                                  (walking through

                                    the door)
                           A scene heading. Or a slug line, as
                           I was taught in film school. Always
                           CAPPED. Usually begins with INT. or
                           EXT. What happens if we --

EXT. TEXAS CAPITOL BUILDING - DAY

Joe looks startled as he stands with April before the seat of
Texas politics.

                                             JOE
                           How’d you do that?

                                             APRIL
                           There was a cut - from the hallway
                           to the capitol. What’d you want to
                           do - ride in a cab?

                                             JOE
                           Dialogue margins.

                                             APRIL
                           Left, 2.5 inches. Right, 2.5
                           inches. Of course, you can cheat
                           those a tad.

                                             JOE
                           So, you have about 3.5 inches for
                           each line of dialogue?

                                             APRIL
                           You’ve got it. And you can sneak
                           out another character or two to the
                           right and no one will hold it
                           against you.

Joe jots down notes on a 3 x 5 card, studies the card for a
moment, then scribbles another note.

                                             JOE
                                  (looking up)
                           And the position of the character’s
                           name?

                                             APRIL
                           ALL CAPS, and tabbed to about 4.0
                           to 4.2 inches, depending upon the
                           look you like. Some writers center
                           all characters’ names in dialogue.
                           Personally, I don’t think it
                           matters too much.

                                             APRIL (CONT'D)
                           The appearance of the script pages
                           is slightly different in each case,
                           but all are within the norm.

                                             JOE
                           Hey! What happened?

                                             APRIL
                           A page break appeared in the middle
                           of my dialogue. You use (MORE) at
                           the bottom of the page to show that
                           the character’s dialogue continues
                           onto the next page. Then add
                           (CONT’D) after the character’s name
                           to show that the lines have roots
                           in the previous page.

                                             JOE
                           But not everyone uses MOREs and
                           CONT’Ds, do they?

INT. CAPITOL BUILDING - DAY

Joe stares up into the dome. April examines the portraits of
Texas governors on the nearby walls.

                                             APRIL
                           Some writers just plan their page
                           breaks so as to avoid them.

                                             JOE
                                  (considering)
                           What about parentheticals?

                                             APRIL
                           Start them about 0.5 inches to the
                           left of the character name tab
                           mark. In our case, that would be at
                           3.0 inches.

                                             JOE
                           And what are they for?

                                             APRIL
                           For years, parentheticals were used
                           to express emotion, the manner in
                           which a character spoke her lines.
                           Loudly, passionately, sadly, and so
                           on. That’s frowned upon these days,
                           but some writers still use them for
                           bits of action.


                                                                                                    5.

                                             JOE
                                  (going up a

                                    stairway)
                           Something like this?

                                             APRIL
                                  (following him)
                           Exactly.

                                             JOE
                           How wide are parentheticals?

                                             APRIL
                           Not very - about 1.5 inches. And
                           they should wrap to the following
                           line when they extend beyond that
                           point.

                                  (pointing to the
                                    top of the page)

                           If you place a parenthetical in the
                           middle of a dialogue passage, it
                           should remain distinct from the
                           dialogue.

A gambling boat is docked along the riverfront. April and Joe
wander about its upper deck.

                                             JOE
                           I have to ask. What happened to CUT
                           TO:s between scenes.

                                             APRIL
                           Some writers still use transitions
                           such as CUT TO: and DISSOLVE TO:
                           between scenes.

                                             JOE
                           Those would introduce a new scene
                           header?

                                             APRIL
                           And typically a different place
                           and/or time. But many writers have
                           dispensed with such transitions,
                           feeling that a new scene header
                           clearly signifies a cut without the
                           need of any additional indicator.

Joe gazes out at the river.


                                                                                                    6.

                                             JOE
                           How did we reach the Mississippi
                           and when did the sun set?

                                             APRIL
                           If you’d rather . . .

EXT. AIRPLANE - SUNSET

A jet liner cruises across Texas towards the setting sun.

INT. AIRPLANE

A customized interior, outfitted with leather chairs and
sofas. April and Joe sip salt-encrusted margaritas.

                                             JOE
                           Is this a flashback?

                                             APRIL
                           Or it could be tomorrow or next
                           month?

TITLE OVER:

                                        October 25, 2014

                                             APRIL (CONT’D)
                           You see, a whole year has passed.

                                             JOE
                           Okay, I didn’t notice. But I
                           thought only DAY and NIGHT were
                           allowed in scene headers.

                                             APRIL
                           Production managers might prefer it
                           that way, but many writers use
                           headers as a means of depicting a
                           particular time of day. For
                           instance, SUNRISE, DAWN, LATE
                           AFTERNOON and SUNSET.

                                             JOE
                           That’s allowed?

                                             APRIL
                           On a writer’s draft, without a
                           doubt.

                                             JOE
                           A writer’s draft?


                                                                                                    7.

                                             APRIL
                           Essentially, any draft that hasn’t
                           been paid for. A draft to be
                           submitted to agents, managers,
                           producers, development execs. Or
                           even to a screenplay competition.
                           Those are writer’s drafts. And they
                           should all be FIRST DRAFTs, no
                           matter how many versions the writer
                           has actually written.

                                             JOE
                           You really think so?

                                             APRIL
                           That’s my recommendation.

INT. BLUE CAMARO - DAY

April drives along Austin’s Congress Avenue as Joe rides
shotgun.

                                             JOE
                           You speak any foreign languages?

                                             APRIL
                                  (in French)
                           Of course, I do. Why do you ask?

                                             JOE
                           What about action sequences?

SUDDENLY, A BLACK MUSTANG

Whips around a corner, racing quickly towards them.

APRIL

Punches the accelerator and --

THE BLUE CAMARO

Leaps forward, laying a trail of rubber. The Camaro takes a
screeching left, then a quick right to accelerate into --

AN ALLEY BURIED IN DEEP SHADOWS

Where the Camaro all too quickly runs into a dead end, just
as --

THE BLACK MUSTANG

Roars into the alley, sealing it shut.


                                                                                                    8.

APRIL

Looks to Joe, fear filling his eyes.

EXT. DRISKILL HOTEL PORTICO - DAY

April guides a dazed and confused Joe from the Camaro towards
the front doors held open by a smiling VALET.

                                             APRIL
                           That’s one way to write an action
                           scene. It’s a variation on the Bill
                           Goldman style used by many pros.

                                             JOE
                                  (coming to)
                           But other writers just use standard
                           scene headers and description for
                           action scenes, don’t they?

                                             APRIL
                           Many do.

INT. DRISKILL HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

A confused Joe speaks into a house phone.

                                             JOE
                           I thought we were walking together.

                                             APRIL (O.S.)
                                  (filtered)
                           Well, we were, but I realized a
                           phone call was needed.

                                             JOE
                           You’re filtered?

                                                                             INTERCUT WITH:

EXT. STATE CAPITOL - DAY

With the capitol dome looming large behind her, April speaks
on her mobile phone.

                                             APRIL
                           Only when you hear my voice over
                           the phone. Radio voices and phone
                           calls can be filtered, though it’s
                           a convention that isn’t used as
                           much these days.


                                                                                                    9.

                                             JOE
                           Let’s try something easy. What
                           about page numbers?

                                             APRIL
                           Number each and every page, though
                           you can start with page two. The
                           numbers should appear in the upper
                           right-hand corner, about 0.5 inches
                           down and 0.75 inches from the right
                           page edge. Those dimensions are not
                           set in stone, but the page numbers
                           should always be placed in the
                           upper right-hand corner.

INT. DRISKILL HOTEL HALLWAY - DAY

Joe strolls slowly towards the seminar room.

                                             JOE
                           You know, that pronouncement almost
                           seemed godlike.

                                             APRIL (V.O.)
                           If it were, I probably would have
                           spoken in a voice-over and not on
                           the phone.

Joe searches the hallway, trying to decide just where this
disembodied voice is emanating from.

                                             JOE
                           What’s a V.O. used for?

                                             APRIL (V.O.)
                           Often for narration, for a
                           narrator’s voice. In film noir, the
                           protagonists often filled the
                           audience in on their thoughts or
                           story details. Scorsese films are
                           often filled with voice-over, as
                           are many documentaries.

INT. DRISKILL HOTEL SEMINAR ROOM - DAY

Joe races past April to reach the podium first. April walks
casually past the still-empty chairs.

At the podium Joe gestures with his hands as if he were
delivering a major political speech.

April sneaks up behind him and mimics his gestures - until he
notices. Joe spins to confront her.


                                                                                                   10.

                                             JOE
                           Why I ought’a . . .

                                             APRIL
                           I was simply demonstrating the way
                           many writers break descriptions
                           into shorter paragraphs. As opposed
                           to allowing description to fill
                           dense blocks running on for lines.

                                             JOE
                           That makes for tougher reading,
                           doesn’t it?

                                             APRIL
                           I know studio readers who claim
                           they skip long description passages
                           and only read dialogue.

                                             JOE
                           But there are pros who write
                           scripts with extended description.

                                             APRIL
                           They do - but that doesn’t mean you
                           should too. When you’re paid to
                           write a screenplay, you just have
                           to satisfy the people writing your
                           checks.

Joe balances on one leg atop the podium.

                                             JOE
                           But when you’re like me, you should
                           stick to format. Is that what
                           you’re trying to say?

                                             APRIL
                           You just want to make your script
                           as easy a read as possible.

Joe jumps down from the podium and hustles out the door just
as conference ATTENDEES begin to enter.

                                             APRIL (CONT’D)
                           By the way, the first time you
                           introduce a character in
                           description, you CAP his name. And
                           when you break a dialogue passage
                           with description, the standard is
                           to place (CONT’D) next to the
                           speaking character’s name.

April watches as a number of people find chairs in front of
her.


                                                                                                   11.

                                             APRIL (CONT’D)
                           Of course, many writers have
                           dropped (CONT’D) from their
                           repertoire. I mean, it’s obvious
                           that I’m still speaking, isn’t it?
                           And that I never stopped speaking.

                                             JOE (O.S.)

                           Hey, April! C’mon! There’s a
                           barbeque at the Governor’s Mansion
                           and a shuttle leaving in two
                           minutes.

                           We haven’t mentioned master scenes.

A sheepish Joe slides back into the seminar room, slowly
walking to the podium.

                           That one I know. No CLOSE UPs, no
                           WIDE SHOTs, mostly no shots of any
                           kind. Just scene headers,
                           description and dialogue. And no
                           scene numbers. Those only belong on
                           shooting scripts.

                                             APRIL
                           It’s okay to sneak in a shot here
                           and there when it’s necessary to
                           highlight a moment or move the
                           action along.

                                             JOE
                           Okay. I can get behind that.

                                             APRIL
                           And don’t worry. I would never let
                           you miss a meal.

                                                                                     FADE OUT.

                                                THE END


                                                                                                   12.

A FEW ADDITIONAL NOTES:

How closely should the format presented on the above pages be
followed?

Close enough so that your script at least resembles these
pages. That said, there is no absolute standard format within
the U.S. film industry. The format used by professional
screenwriters can vary considerably from writer to writer -
but overall the format used by one professional writer
generally resembles that used by another professional writer.
Nuances may vary – margins slightly different, a dash here or
there, parentheticals used this way or that or not at all –
but overall, professional screenplays fit within or near
these guidelines.

Clarity is the goal. If your script’s format can be easily
read by anyone working in the film industry, then it falls
within acceptable standards.

Do realize that “shooting scripts,” the form in which scripts
are most often available online, in books and at libraries,
are not the form in which most professional writers submit
their scripts. Submission scripts, sales scripts, first draft
scripts – all usually share certain characteristics: no scene
numbers, few designated camera shots and sequences generally
written in master scenes.

If you’re confused about which nuances are acceptable and
which would push your script into an “out-of-format”
category, you would do well to follow these guidelines and
eliminate those questionable nuances.

(Condensed Financial Services Financial Statements)
　 　The following schedules show unaudited condensed financial statements for the Financial Services segment and all other
segments excluding Financial Services. These presentations are not in accordance with IFRS, which is used by Sony to prepare its
consolidated financial statements. However, because the Financial Services segment is different in nature from Sony’s other segments,
Sony believes that a comparative presentation may be useful in understanding and analyzing Sony’s consolidated financial statements.
Both financial statements include transactions between the Financial Services segment and Sony without the Financial Services
segment. The figures shown in the respective presentations for the Financial Services segment and Sony without the Financial Services
segment are prior to the elimination and/or offset of such transactions and deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities of each. The
condensed consolidated financial statements column is presented net of the elimination and/or offset of such intercompany balances
and deferred tax assets and liabilities.

Accounting Policy and Other Information
(Changes in accounting policies)

    　　Sony newly adopted the following accounting standards and interpretations from the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024:
    IFRS 17 “Insurance Contracts”
    　　The IASB issued IFRS 17 “Insurance Contracts” (“IFRS 17”) in May 2017 and Amendments to IFRS 17 in June 2020 and
    December 2021. IFRS 17 replaces IFRS 4 “Insurance Contracts” and sets out principles for the recognition, measurement,
    presentation, and disclosure of insurance contracts within the scope of IFRS 17. IFRS 17 provides a general model, supplemented
    by a specific approach for contracts with direct participation features (the variable fee approach), and a simplified approach (the
    premium allocation approach) mainly for short-duration contracts.
    　　IFRS 17 was effective for Sony as of April 1, 2023. Sony has retrospectively applied changes in accounting policies resulting
    from the adoption of IFRS 17 unless it was impracticable. Sony applied the modified retrospective approach, which uses reasonable
    and supportable information, or the fair value approach, which uses the fair value as of April 1, 2022, the transition date for IFRS
    17, to identify, recognize, and measure certain groups of insurance contracts as of the transition date for IFRS 17, for which it was
    impracticable to apply the full retrospective approach. Therefore, Sony has restated the consolidated financial statements for
    comparative periods and the consolidated statement of financial position as of April 1, 2022 on the basis of the retrospective
    application of IFRS 17. The effects of the retrospective application of IFRS 17 on Sony’s total equity as of April 1, 2022 are
    presented in the consolidated statements of changes in stockholders’ equity.

                                                                                         F-20

Sales increased 2 trillion 46.4 billion yen (19%) compared to the previous fiscal year (“year-on-year”) to 13 trillion 20.8 billion yen.
This significant increase was mainly due to significant increases in sales in the Financial Services, Game &amp; Network Services
(“G&amp;NS”), Music and Imaging &amp; Sensing Solutions (“I&amp;SS”) segments. On a constant currency basis, sales increased approximately
13% year-on-year. For further details about the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on sales and operating income (loss), see
Note on page 10.

Operating income decreased 93.6 billion yen year-on-year to 1 trillion 208.8 billion yen. This decrease was mainly due to a
significant decrease in operating income in the Financial Services segment and a decrease in operating income in the I&amp;SS segment,
partially offset by increases in operating income in the G&amp;NS and Music segments.

Operating income for the current fiscal year included the following:
・Remeasurement gain resulting from the consolidation of a company previously accounted for using the equity method: 6.0 billion
yen (Music segment)
・Realized and remeasurement gains resulting from the transfer of a portion of shares of Sony Payment Services Inc. (“Sony Payment
Services”): 19.8 billion yen (Financial Services segment)

Operating income for the previous fiscal year included the following:
・Impact of litigation settlements, net of expenses, received in relation to lawsuits for Recorded Music and Music Publishing: 5.7
billion yen (Music segment)
・Recovery of an unauthorized withdrawal of funds at a subsidiary of Sony Life Insurance Co., Ltd. (“Sony Life”) which occurred in
the previous fiscal year: 22.1 billion yen (Financial Services segment)

The share of profit (loss) of investments accounted for using the equity method, recorded within operating income, decreased 13.9
billion yen year-on-year to 10.5 billion yen. This significant decrease was mainly due to a decrease in the share of profit of
investments in All Other.

The net effect of financial income and expenses was income of 59.8 billion yen, compared to an expense of 27.9 billion yen in the
previous fiscal year. This significant improvement was primarily due to the recording of unrealized gains mainly on Sony’s shares of
Spotify Technology S.A. in the current fiscal year, compared to the recording of unrealized losses on such shares in the previous fiscal
year.

Income before income taxes was 1 trillion 268.7 billion yen, essentially flat year-on-year.

During the current fiscal year, Sony recorded 288.2 billion yen of income tax expense, resulting in an effective tax rate of 22.7%,
which was higher than the effective tax rate of 20.6% in the previous fiscal year. This higher tax rate was mainly due to the absence of
a decrease in deferred tax liabilities that occurred in the previous fiscal year related to Japan controlled foreign company taxation,
partially offset mainly by a 7.6 billion yen decrease in tax expense in the current fiscal year from the dissolution of a subsidiary.

Net income attributable to Sony Group Corporation’s stockholders, which deducts net income attributable to noncontrolling
interests, decreased 34.7 billion yen year-on-year to 970.6 billion yen.

Adjusted OIBDA was 1 trillion 826.1 billion yen, essentially flat year-on-year. This result was mainly due to a significant increase in
Adjusted OIBDA in the G&amp;NS segment as well as increases in Adjusted OIBDA in the Music and I&amp;SS segments, substantially offset
by a significant decrease in Adjusted OIBDA in the Financial Services segment. Adjusted EBITDA was 1 trillion 818.0 billion yen,
essentially flat year-on-year. This result was mainly due to the same factors affecting Adjusted OIBDA and a decrease in net foreign
exchange losses recorded within financial expenses.

                                                                               - 2 -


Cash Flows

For Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, charts showing Sony’s cash flow information for all segments, all segments excluding the Financial Services
segment and the Financial Services segment alone, please refer to pages F-8 and F-19.

Operating Activities: During the current fiscal year, there was a net cash inflow of 1 trillion 373.2 billion yen from operating
activities, an increase of 1 trillion 58.5 billion yen year-on-year.

For all segments excluding the Financial Services segment, there was a net cash inflow of 1 trillion 177.8 billion yen, an increase of
762.4 billion yen year-on-year. This increase was primarily due to a decrease in inventories compared to an increase in the previous
fiscal year and a year-on-year increase in income before income taxes after taking into account non-cash adjustments (including
depreciation and amortization, including amortization of contract costs, other operating (income) expense, net and (gain) loss on
securities, net). This increase in net cash inflow was partially offset by the negative impact of a larger increase in trade receivables and
contract assets.

The Financial Services segment had a net cash inflow of 246.4 billion yen, compared to a net cash outflow of 56.3 billion yen in the
previous fiscal year. This change was mainly due to a year-on-year increase in sales of investments in the Financial Services segment.

Investing Activities: During the current fiscal year, Sony used 818.9 billion yen of net cash in investing activities, a decrease of 233.8
billion yen year-on-year.

For all segments excluding the Financial Services segment, there was a net cash outflow of 794.2 billion yen, a decrease of 237.8
billion yen year-on-year. This decrease was mainly due to the acquisition of shares of Bungie, Inc., an additional investment in Epic
Games, Inc. and a payment related to the acquisition of Industrial Media, all of which were incurred in the previous fiscal year.

The Financial Services segment used 25.7 billion yen of net cash in investing activities, essentially flat year-on-year.

Financing Activities: Net cash outflow from financing activities during the current fiscal year was 210.7 billion yen, compared to a
net cash inflow of 84.3 billion yen in the previous fiscal year.

For all segments excluding the Financial Services segment, there was a 197.3 billion yen net cash outflow, compared to a net cash
inflow of 95.5 billion yen in the previous fiscal year. The cash outflow in the current fiscal year was primarily due to the procurement
of long-term bank loans in the previous fiscal year and a year-on-year increase in payments for the repurchase of Sony’s own common
stock.

In the Financial Services segment, there was a 63.4 billion yen net cash outflow, an increase of 10.8 billion yen year-on-year. This
increase was mainly due to an increase in dividend payments.

Total Cash and Cash Equivalents: Accounting for the above factors and the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the total
outstanding balance of cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2024 was 1 trillion 907.1 billion yen. Cash and cash equivalents of
all segments excluding the Financial Services segment was 993.3 billion yen as of March 31, 2024, an increase of 268.9 billion yen
compared with the balance as of March 31, 2023. Within the Financial Services segment, the outstanding balance of cash and cash
equivalents was 913.8 billion yen as of March 31, 2024, an increase of 157.3 billion yen compared with the balance as of March 31,
2023.

                                                                               - 3 -

Sales are expected to decrease year-on-year primarily due to an expected significant decrease in sales in the Financial Services
segment and expected decreases in the Entertainment, Technology &amp; Services and G&amp;NS segments, partially offset by an expected
significant increase in sales in the I&amp;SS segment and an expected increase in sales in the Music segment.

Operating income is expected to increase year-on-year primarily due to an expected significant increase in operating income in the
I&amp;SS segment and expected increases in operating income in the G&amp;NS and Music segments, partially offset by an expected decrease
in operating income in the Financial Services segment as well as a significant increase in the operating loss in All Other, Corporate
and elimination.

Income before income taxes is expected to be essentially flat year-on-year, mainly due to an expected decrease in financial income as
a result of unrealized gains and losses on securities not being included in the May forecast, compared to the previous fiscal year in
which Sony recorded 71.4 billion yen of unrealized gains on securities, substantially offset by the impact of the above-mentioned
increase in operating income.

Net income attributable to Sony Group Corporation’s stockholders is expected to decrease year-on-year, mainly due to an expected
increase in income taxes resulting from a decrease in tax credits in both Japan and the United States.

Adjusted OIBDA is expected to increase year-on-year primarily due to an expected significant increase in Adjusted OIBDA in the

significant increase in Adjusted OIBDA loss in All Other, Corporate and elimination as well as an expected decrease in Adjusted
OIBDA in the Financial Services segment. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to increase year-on-year due to the same factors affecting
Adjusted OIBDA.

*1 Transactions between the Financial Services segment and Sony without the Financial Services segment are included in those

*2 The differences between Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted OIBDA on a consolidated basis represent financial income and financial
  expenses (excluding interest expenses, net, and gains on revaluation of equity instruments, net). Adjusted EBITDA by segment is
  not calculated and disclosed because Sony does not include financial income and financial expenses in its performance evaluations
  by segment, mainly due to the fact that Sony manages its foreign exchange exposure centrally and globally, except for the Financial
  Services segment.

Game &amp; Network Services (G&amp;NS)

Results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024
Sales increased 623.1 billion yen (17%) year-on-year to 4 trillion 267.7 billion yen (a 9% increase on a constant currency basis). This
significant increase in sales was mainly due to an increase in sales of non-first-party titles, including add-on content, and the impact of
foreign exchange rates.

Operating income increased 40.2 billion yen year-on-year to 290.2 billion yen. This increase in operating income was mainly due to
the impact of the above-mentioned increase in sales of non-first-party titles and the positive impact of foreign exchange rates, partially
offset by the impact of an increase in losses from hardware, mainly due to promotions, and the impact of a decrease in sales of first-
party titles. During the current fiscal year, there was a 38.6 billion yen positive impact from foreign exchange rate fluctuations.

Adjusted OIBDA significantly increased 70.9 billion yen year-on-year to 407.9 billion yen due to the same factors affecting operating
income.

Forecast for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025
Sales are expected to decrease mainly due to an expected decrease in sales of hardware resulting from lower unit sales, partially offset
by an expected increase in sales of non-first-party titles including add-on content. Operating income and Adjusted OIBDA are
expected to increase mainly due to a decrease in losses from hardware resulting from the above-mentioned expected lower unit sales
and the impact of an expected increase in Network Services sales, primarily from PlayStation®Plus, partially offset by the impact of
an expected decrease in sales of first-party titles.

Music

The Music segment results include the yen-based results of Sony Music Entertainment (Japan) Inc. and the yen-translated results of
Sony Music Entertainment (“SME”) and Sony Music Publishing LLC (“SMP”), which aggregate the results of their worldwide
subsidiaries on a U.S. dollar basis.

Results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024
Sales increased 238.3 billion yen year-on-year (17%) to 1 trillion 619.0 billion yen (a 12% increase on a constant currency basis). This
significant increase in sales was primarily due to an increase in revenues from streaming services, primarily from paid subscriptions,
in Recorded Music and Music Publishing and the impact of foreign exchange rates, as well as an increase in revenues from
merchandise, live and other sales in Recorded Music.

Operating income increased 38.6 billion yen year-on-year to 301.7 billion yen. This increase in operating income was primarily due to
the impact of the above-mentioned increases in sales for Recorded Music and Music Publishing, as well as the positive impact of
foreign exchange rates and a 6.0 billion yen remeasurement gain resulting from the consolidation of a company previously accounted
for using the equity method. These factors were partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, as well
as the impact of litigation settlements, net of expenses, of 5.7 billion yen received in the previous fiscal year in relation to lawsuits for
Recorded Music and Music Publishing.

Adjusted OIBDA increased 52.3 billion yen year-on-year to 368.7 billion yen, mainly due to the same factors affecting operating
income, excluding the above-mentioned impact of litigation settlements and the remeasurement gain.

Forecast for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025
Sales are expected to increase year-on-year mainly due to higher revenues primarily from streaming services in Recorded Music and
Music Publishing. Operating income is expected to increase year-on-year mainly due to the impact of the above-mentioned increase in
sales, partially offset by an expected increase in depreciation and amortization expenses as well as the absence of the 6.0 billion yen

                                                                               - 7 -


remeasurement gain resulting from the consolidation of a company previously accounted for using the equity method, which was
recorded in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024. Adjusted OIBDA is also expected to increase year-on-year primarily due to the
same factors affecting operating income, excluding the above-mentioned increase in depreciation and amortization expenses and the
remeasurement gain.

Pictures

The Pictures segment results are the yen-translated results of Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc. (“SPE”), which aggregates the results of its worldwide
subsidiaries on a U.S. dollar basis. Management analyzes the results of SPE in U.S. dollars, so discussion of certain portions of its results is specified as being on
“a U.S. dollar basis.”

Results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024
Sales increased 123.6 billion yen, a 9% increase year-on-year (a 2% increase on a U.S. dollar basis), to 1 trillion 493.1 billion yen.
This increase in sales on a U.S. dollar basis was primarily due to an increase in theatrical releases and higher revenues for Crunchyroll
resulting from paid subscriber growth. These increases in sales were partially offset by a decrease in series deliveries in Television
Productions due to the impact of the strikes in Hollywood and lower licensing revenues from catalog product in Motion Pictures
compared to the previous fiscal year, which benefitted from the contribution of several franchise films released theatrically in the
fiscal year ended March 31, 2022.

Operating income was 117.7 billion yen, essentially flat year-on-year (a 10% decrease on a U.S. dollar basis). This decrease in
operating income on a U.S. dollar basis was primarily due to higher marketing costs in support of a greater number of theatrical
releases, substantially offset by the impact of the above-mentioned increase in sales.

Adjusted OIBDA was 171.2 billion yen, essentially flat year-on-year (a 6% decrease on a U.S. dollar basis), primarily due to the same
factors affecting operating income.

Forecast for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025
Sales are expected to be essentially flat year-on-year due to a decrease in series deliveries in Television Productions mainly due to the
impact of the strikes in Hollywood, substantially offset by expected higher sales in Media Networks, primarily from Crunchyroll, and
expected higher sales for films to be released theatrically in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025 including several franchise films.
Operating income and Adjusted OIBDA are expected to be essentially flat year-on-year due to the impact of the above-mentioned
increase in sales for Media Networks, substantially offset by the impact of the above-mentioned decrease in sales for Television
Productions.

Entertainment, Technology &amp; Services (ET&amp;S)

Results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024
Sales were 2 trillion 453.7 billion yen, essentially flat year-on-year (a 5% decrease on a constant currency basis). This result was
primarily due to a decrease in sales of televisions resulting from lower unit sales, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange
rates.

Operating income increased 7.9 billion yen year-on-year to 187.4 billion yen. This increase in operating income was primarily due to
the positive impact of foreign exchange rates and reductions in operating expenses, partially offset by the impact of the above-
mentioned lower unit sales of televisions. During the current fiscal year, there was a 20.5 billion yen positive impact from foreign
exchange rate fluctuations.

Adjusted OIBDA increased 12.2 billion yen year-on-year to 289.1 billion yen, primarily due to the same factors affecting operating
income.

Forecast for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025
Sales are expected to decrease primarily due to a decrease in sales of televisions resulting from lower unit sales. Operating income and
Adjusted OIBDA are expected to be essentially flat year-on-year due to reductions in operating expenses, substantially offset by the
impact of the above-mentioned lower unit sales of televisions.

                                                                               - 8 -


Imaging &amp; Sensing Solutions (I&amp;SS)

Results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024
Sales increased 200.6 billion yen (14%) year-on-year to 1 trillion 602.7 billion yen (a 7% increase on a constant currency basis). This
significant increase in sales was mainly due to an increase in sales of image sensors for mobile products resulting from an increase in
unit sales as well as an improvement in the product mix, and the impact of foreign exchange rates.

Operating income decreased 18.7 billion yen year-on-year to 193.5 billion yen. This decrease in operating income was mainly due to
an increase in depreciation and amortization expenses, an increase in costs associated with the launch of mass production of a new
image sensor for mobile products, as well as an increase in manufacturing costs. These negative factors were partially offset by the
impact of the above-mentioned increase in sales and the positive impact of foreign exchange rates. During the current fiscal year, there
was a 62.3 billion yen positive impact from foreign exchange rate fluctuations.

Adjusted OIBDA increased 32.6 billion yen year-on-year to 441.4 billion yen, mainly due to the impact of the above-mentioned
increase in sales and the positive impact of foreign exchange rates. These positive factors were partially offset by the above-mentioned
increase in costs associated with the launch of mass production of a new image sensor for mobile products and increase in
manufacturing costs.

Forecast for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025
Sales are expected to significantly increase primarily due to an expected increase in sales of image sensors for mobile products
resulting from an increase in unit sales as well as an improvement in the product mix. Operating income is expected to significantly
increase year-on-year primarily due to the impact of the above-mentioned increase in sales and a decrease in costs associated with the
launch of mass production of a new image sensor for mobile products, partially offset by an increase in manufacturing costs and an
increase in depreciation and amortization expenses. Adjusted OIBDA is expected to significantly increase due to the same factors
affecting operating income, excluding the above-mentioned increase in depreciation and amortization expenses.

Financial Services

The Financial Services segment results include Sony Financial Group Inc. (“SFGI”) and SFGI’s consolidated subsidiaries such as Sony Life, Sony Assurance
Inc., and Sony Bank Inc. The results discussed in the Financial Services segment differ from the results that SFGI and SFGI’s consolidated subsidiaries disclose
separately on a Japanese statutory basis.

Results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024
Financial services revenue increased 880.9 billion yen year-on-year to 1 trillion 770.0 billion yen, mainly due to a significant increase
in revenue at Sony Life. Revenue at Sony Life increased 843.1 billion yen year-on-year to 1 trillion 523.9 billion yen, mainly due to an
increase in net gains on investments in the separate accounts related to market fluctuations.

Operating income decreased 144.5 billion yen year-on-year to 173.6 billion yen. This significant decrease in operating income was
mainly due to a significant decrease in operating income at Sony Life, as well as the recording of a 22.1 billion yen gain from the
recovery of an unauthorized withdrawal of funds at a subsidiary of Sony Life in the previous fiscal year, partially offset by the
recording of 19.8 billion yen in realized and remeasurement gains resulting from the transfer of a portion of shares of Sony Payment
Services. Operating income at Sony Life decreased 143.5 billion yen year-on-year to 126.4 billion yen, mainly due to the decrease in
net gains related to market fluctuations for variable life insurance and other products, and the recording of a gain from the sale of real
estate in the previous fiscal year.

Adjusted OIBDA significantly decreased 140.9 billion yen year-on-year to 181.5 billion yen, primarily due to the same factors
affecting operating income, excluding the above-mentioned realized and remeasurement gains and the impact of the recovery of the
unauthorized withdrawal of funds.

Forecast for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025
Financial services revenue is expected to significantly decrease year-on-year primarily due to absence of the increase in net gains on
investments related to market fluctuations in the separate accounts at Sony Life recorded in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024.
Operating income is expected to decrease year-on-year primarily due to the absence of the realized and remeasurement gains resulting
from the transfer of a portion of shares of Sony Payment Services, as well as the absence of recording of the gains related to market
fluctuations for variable life insurance and other products in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024. Adjusted OIBDA is expected to

                                                                               - 9 -


decrease due to the same factors affecting operating income, excluding the above-mentioned realized and remeasurement gains.
The effects of future gains and losses on investments held by the Financial Services segment due to market fluctuations have not been
incorporated within the above forecast as it is difficult for Sony to predict market trends in the future. Accordingly, future market
fluctuations could further impact the above forecast.
The above forecast is based on management’s current expectations and is subject to uncertainties and changes in circumstances.
Actual results may differ materially from those included in this forecast due to a variety of factors. See “Cautionary Statement” below.
Note
Sales on a Constant Currency Basis and Impact of Foreign Exchange Rate Fluctuations
The descriptions of sales on a constant currency basis reflect sales calculated by applying the yen’s monthly average exchange rates
from the same period of the previous fiscal year to local currency-denominated monthly sales in the relevant period of the current
fiscal year. For SME and SMP in the Music segment, and in the Pictures segment, the constant currency amounts are calculated by
applying the monthly average U.S. dollar / yen exchange rates after aggregation on a U.S. dollar basis.
Results for the Pictures segment are described on a U.S. dollar basis as the Pictures segment reflects the operations of SPE, a U.S.-
based operation that aggregates the results of its worldwide subsidiaries in U.S. dollars.
The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on sales is calculated by applying the change in the yen’s periodic weighted average
exchange rate for the same period of the previous fiscal year from the relevant period of the current fiscal year to the major
transactional currencies in which the sales are denominated. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on operating income
(loss) is calculated by subtracting from the impact on sales the impact on cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses
calculated by applying the same major transactional currencies calculation process to cost of sales and selling, general and
administrative expenses as for the impact on sales. The I&amp;SS segment enters into its own foreign exchange hedging transactions, and
the impact of those transactions is included in the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on sales and operating income (loss) for
that segment.
This information is not a substitute for Sony’s consolidated financial statements measured in accordance with IFRS. However, Sony
believes that these disclosures provide additional useful analytical information to investors regarding the operating performance of
Sony.

Financial Targets of Mid-Range Plan

(1) Financial Targets and Results of the Fourth Mid-Range Plan
In the Fourth Mid-Range Plan for the three fiscal years started on April 1, 2021 and ended on March 31, 2024, Sony established a
financial target (Group KPI) of cumulative Adjusted EBITDA of 4.3 trillion yen on a consolidated basis. As a result of progress
exceeding the initial plan, mainly in the Music and Pictures segments, the cumulative results were approximately 5.1 trillion yen, 19%
higher than the target.

(2) Financial Targets of the Fifth Mid-Range Plan
In the Fifth Mid-Range Plan for the three fiscal years started on April 1, 2024 and ending on March 31, 2027, Sony has placed greater
emphasis on profit-based growth, and has set as the most important metrics (Group KPIs) the growth rate of consolidated operating
income and the operating income margin for Sony without the Financial Services segment. Specifically, Sony will target an average
annual growth rate of consolidated operating income for the three-year period of 10% or more, and a three-year cumulative
consolidated operating income margin of 10% or more.

(3) Shareholder Returns
Regarding shareholder returns, Sony plans to place emphasis on its total payout ratio, which Sony expects to gradually increase
throughout the period of the Fifth Mid-Range Plan, aiming for approximately 40% in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2027, the final
fiscal year of the plan. To achieve this target, Sony has set parameters of 250 billion yen for the repurchase of shares in the fiscal year
ending March 31, 2025, which exceeds the amount Sony acquired in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024. Please refer to the Note
“Subsequent Events (Setting of parameters for repurchase of shares of its own common stock)” on Page F-22 for more details.
Regarding dividends, Sony’s policy is to continue to increase dividends steadily while accelerating the pace of dividend increases.

Dividend Information

In light of the consolidated financial results forecast for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025 described in “Outlook for the Fiscal
Year Ending March 31, 2025” above and other factors, Sony has determined the dividend forecasted for the fiscal year ending March
31, 2025 as follows. Sony intends to determine the actual amount of dividends based on an overall consideration of its consolidated
operating results, financial condition, future business expansions and other factors.

* As described in the Note “Subsequent Events (Stock Split)” on Page F-22, Sony Group Corporation decided at the Board of Directors meeting held on May 14,
2024 to conduct a stock split, scheduled to be effective on October 1, 2024 with a record date of September 30, 2024. Each share of Sony’s common stock will be
split into five (5) shares per share. The above year-end dividend per share forecast for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025 is based on a number of shares
taking into account the stock split. The total annual dividend per share forecast for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025 is not presented because the total of the
interim dividend and the year-end dividend cannot be calculated due to effect of the stock split. Without taking the stock split into account, the year-end dividend
per share forecast for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025 would be 50 yen and the total annual dividend per share forecast for the fiscal year ending March 31,
2025 would be 100 yen.

Basic Views on Selection of Accounting Standards
Sony has voluntarily adopted IFRS from the first quarter of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, with the goal of further streamlining
and maintaining the quality of Sony’s financial and management reporting systems over the mid- to long-term, and with the aim of
improving the international comparability of financial information in the capital markets.
Supplemental Information
Regarding Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted EBITDA
Sony believes that Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted EBITDA are performance metrics suitable for the long-term management that Sony
prioritizes. This is because (i) they represent the sustainable earnings power of the business as they do not include the effects of one-
time gains and losses, (ii) they enable management to confirm that all the businesses of the Sony Group, including the Financial
Services business, are expanding over the mid- to long-term through cycles of investment and return, and (iii) they are often used to
calculate corporate value. Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures in accordance with IFRS. However, Sony
believes that these disclosures may be useful information to investors. Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted EBITDA should be considered
in addition to, not as a substitute for, Sony’s results in accordance with IFRS.

  Adjusted OIBDA (Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization) is calculated by the following formula:
    Adjusted OIBDA = Operating income + Depreciation and amortization expense excluding amortization for film costs and
    broadcasting rights, as well as for internally developed game content and master recordings included in Content assets - the profit
    and loss amount that Sony deems non-recurring
  Adjusted EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization) is calculated by the following formula:
    Adjusted EBITDA = Net income attributable to Sony Group Corporation’s stockholders + Net income attributable to
    noncontrolling interests + Income taxes + Interest expenses, net, recorded in Financial income and Financial expense - Gain on
    revaluation of equity instruments, net, recorded in Financial income and Financial expense + Depreciation and amortization
    expense excluding amortization for film costs and broadcasting rights, as well as for internally developed game content and master
    recordings included in Content assets - the profit and loss amount that Sony deems non-recurring

                                                                              - 12 -


The following table shows a reconciliation of Adjusted OIBDA from operating income in accordance with IFRS for the fiscal years
ended March 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively.

Cautionary Statement

Statements made in this release with respect to Sony’s current plans, estimates, strategies and beliefs and other statements that are not
historical facts are forward-looking statements about the future performance of Sony. Forward-looking statements include, but are not
limited to, those statements using words such as “believe,” “expect,” “plans,” “strategy,” “prospects,” “forecast,” “estimate,”
“project,” “anticipate,” “aim,” “intend,” “seek,” “may,” “might,” “could” or “should,” and words of similar meaning in connection
with a discussion of future operations, financial performance, events or conditions. From time to time, oral or written forward-looking
statements may also be included in other materials released to the public. These statements are based on management’s assumptions,
judgments and beliefs in light of the information currently available to it. Sony cautions investors that a number of important risks and
uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements, and therefore
investors should not place undue reliance on them. Investors also should not rely on any obligation of Sony to update or revise any
forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Sony disclaims any such obligation.
Risks and uncertainties that might affect Sony include, but are not limited to:
(i) Sony’s ability to maintain product quality and customer satisfaction with its products and services;
(ii) Sony’s ability to continue to design and develop and win acceptance of, as well as achieve sufficient cost reductions for, its

         products and services, including image sensors, game and network platforms, smartphones and televisions, which are offered
         in highly competitive markets characterized by severe price competition and continual new product and service introductions,
         rapid development in technology and subjective and changing customer preferences;
(iii) Sony’s ability to implement successful hardware, software, and content integration strategies, and to develop and implement
         successful sales and distribution strategies in light of new technologies and distribution platforms;
(iv) the effectiveness of Sony’s strategies and their execution, including but not limited to the success of Sony’s acquisitions, joint
         ventures, investments, capital expenditures, restructurings and other strategic initiatives;
(v) changes in laws, regulations and government policies in the markets in which Sony and its third-party suppliers, service
         providers and business partners operate, including those related to taxation, as well as growing consumer focus on corporate
         social responsibility;
(vi) Sony’s continued ability to identify the products, services and market trends with significant growth potential, to devote
         sufficient resources to research and development, to prioritize investments and capital expenditures correctly and to recoup its
         investments and capital expenditures, including those required for technology development and product capacity;
(vii) Sony’s reliance on external business partners, including for the procurement of parts, components, software and network
         services for its products or services, the manufacturing, marketing and distribution of its products, and its other business
         operations;
(viii) the global economic and political environment in which Sony operates and the economic and political conditions in Sony’s
         markets, particularly levels of consumer spending;
(ix) Sony’s ability to meet operational and liquidity needs as a result of significant volatility and disruption in the global financial
         markets or a ratings downgrade;
(x) Sony’s ability to forecast demands, manage timely procurement and control inventories;
(xi) foreign exchange rates, particularly between the yen and the U.S. dollar, the euro and other currencies in which Sony makes
         significant sales and incurs production costs, or in which Sony’s assets, liabilities and operating results are denominated;
(xii) Sony’s ability to recruit, retain and maintain productive relations with highly skilled personnel;
(xiii) Sony’s ability to prevent unauthorized use or theft of intellectual property rights, to obtain or renew licenses relating to
         intellectual property rights and to defend itself against claims that its products or services infringe the intellectual property
         rights owned by others;
(xiv) the impact of changes in interest rates and unfavorable conditions or developments (including market fluctuations or volatility)
         in the Japanese equity markets on the revenue and operating income of the Financial Services segment;
(xv) shifts in customer demand for financial services such as life insurance and Sony’s ability to conduct successful asset liability
         management in the Financial Services segment;
(xvi) risks related to catastrophic disasters, geopolitical conflicts, pandemic disease or similar events;
(xvii) the ability of Sony, its third-party service providers or business partners to anticipate and manage cybersecurity risk, including
         the risk of unauthorized access to Sony’s business information and the personally identifiable information of its employees and
         customers, potential business disruptions or financial losses; and
(xviii) the outcome of pending and/or future legal and/or regulatory proceedings.

Risks and uncertainties also include the impact of any future events with material adverse impact. The continued impact of
developments relating to the situations in Ukraine and Russia and in the Middle East could heighten many of the risks and
uncertainties noted above. Important information regarding risks and uncertainties is also set forth in Sony’s most recent Form 20-F,
which is on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
